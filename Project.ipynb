    "# 1. Introduction \n",
    "This project is a part of the Data Science Fundamentals course at ISCTE-IUL. The goal of this project is to predict the salary of a LinkedIn user based on the information available on job offers. The dataset used in this project is the LinkedIn dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about 19000 LinkedIn users and 39000 job offers. The dataset is available on Kaggle: [LinkedIn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adampq/linkedin-jobs-machine-learning-data-set)\n",
